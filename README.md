Hi there! This is my finished project for the countries side project in the Full Stack Open course.

### Running the app
To run the app, make sure you have React installed and simply run `npm run start`

### Playing around with the app
In the search bar, place any filter that you see fit. From there you can click the show button to show the full view for
the country.
NOTE: this feature works for MOST countries but tends to get a little funky for countries like "South Sudan".

Alternatively, you can place the full name of the country in the filter box and it'll render the view for that country.
